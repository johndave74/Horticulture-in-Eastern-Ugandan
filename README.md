## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- **Empower Women:** Develop training, funding, and outreach programs to increase women‚Äôs involvement in horticultural activities.
- **Address Seasonal Gaps:** Invest in storage, irrigation, or greenhouse technologies to reduce the impact of low-revenue months.
- **Replicate Success:** Study Atari‚Äôs practices and replicate them across underperforming sites for balanced growth.
- **Advanced Tracking:** Incorporate additional KPIs like yield per plot, cost analysis, and profit margins for deeper insights.
- **Community Engagement:** Use insights to inform local communities, NGOs, and policymakers for data-driven decisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Next Steps

- Refine the dashboard by adding **trend analysis**, **forecasts**, and **interactive filters**.
- Collect more granular data (e.g., crop types, yield per hectare, weather data).
- Share findings with local stakeholders to **drive action and impact**.
- Continue improving Power BI skills with advanced visualizations and DAX measures.
